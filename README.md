# File-Inclusion-Lab
Web and Mobile App Security

**Lab Objective part1:**

In this lab, we will learn to create a vulnerable web application through XAMPP in PHP. First Users can have a path traversal to browse the content of files located in a web server. Then the user can upload a malicious script file and run the file.

This lab gives readers a first impression of Local file inclusion(LFI) and remote file inclusion(RFI). RFI/LFI attacks enable hackers to execute malicious code and steal data through the manipulation of a companyâ€™s web server.

**Lab Objective part2:**

Part 2 will focus on preventing LFI & RFI, securing the web application.
